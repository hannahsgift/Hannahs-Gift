				<h2>Video Pop-Up Game</h2>
				<p>JavaScript program that will grab Q&amp;A from a file and videos from links.</p>

				<p>Start screen will have options to play either Percy Jackson, Winnie the Pooh or Harry Potter.</p>

				<p>Video will start and play for a random amount of time then stop for a Q&amp;A. After a one button switch answer it will show correct answer and then continue to play. This will happen until the video ends.</p>

				<p>May incorporate a mobile version to have for her in transit use.  This version, if done, will stop the video for a few seconds to let her think about answer and then start movie again.</p>

				<h2>Audio Game</h2>
				<p>JavaScript game that will challenge hearing abilities.</p>

				<p>Objective: Player tries to find the “sources” of the background music and gain the highest score</p>

				<p>Listen to audio balance of the music. If the music is louder on the right side then player will need to swipe from the right or use Eyegaze and look at the right to shift the volume to the leftward direction. Vice versa for left side.</p>

				<p>Every step costs a point but finding a source will give you more points. See how high your score can go by the end of the playlist.</p>

				<p>Customizable settings such as user-created playlist</p>

				<p>Back End Server will store the playlist needed for the game.</p>
